# ImageZoom
Simple javascript lib to allow image zoom and drag.  Currently this project supports mouse and touch events (Pinch is next to add).  the intention is to keep this library as simple as possible and not depend on any other libraries.

check out the [demo](https://eldinocodes.github.io/ImageZoom/example) for a working example.
